Following commands should be followed while executing the folder:

$make

// This will compile all the .c files and .cu files

$./run_script

// This will run all the files present in the folder and will also generate different graphs

 After executing run_script, several plots will be generated:

 correct_sup_vector.png : speedup vs problem size with different block sizes

 speedup_both.png : speedup comparison of vector addition and square of set of numbers

 plot_square.png : time vs problem size for comparison of serial and parallel code of square of set of numbers

 plot_tp : throughput vs problem size for comparison of vector addition and square of set of numbers

 correct_tp_vector.png : throughput vs problem size with different block sizes for vector addition

correct_time_vector.png : time vs problem size for different block sizes of vector addition

plot_vector.png : time vs problem size for comparison of serial and parallel code of vector addition
